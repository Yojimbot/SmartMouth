What to do when a hurricane is 6 hours from arriving?	If you're not in an area that is recommended for evacuation, plan to stay at home or where you are and let friends and family know where you are.  Close storm shutters, and stay away from windows. Flying glass from broken windows could injure you.  Turn your refrigerator or freezer to the coldest setting and open only when necessary. If you lose power, food will last longer. Keep a thermometer in the refrigerator to be able to check the food temperature when the power is restored.  Turn on your TV/radio, or check your city/county website every 30 minutes in order to get the latest weather updates and emergency instructions. https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/98105	https://www.ready.gov/hurricanes
What to do when a hurricane is 6-18 hours from arriving?	Turn on your TV/radio, or check your city/county website every 30 minutes in order to get the latest weather updates and emergency instructions.    Charge your cell phone now so you will have a full battery in case you lose power.	https://www.ready.gov/hurricanes
What to do when a hurricane is 18-36 hours from arriving?	Bring loose, lightweight objects inside that could become projectiles in high winds (e.g., patio furniture, garbage cans); anchor objects that would be unsafe to bring inside (e.g., propane tanks); and trim or remove trees close enough to fall on the building.   Cover all of your home's windows. Permanent storm shutters offer the best protection for windows. A second option is to board up windows with 5/8" exterior grade or marine plywood, cut to fit and ready to install.	https://www.ready.gov/hurricanes
What to do when a hurricane is 36 hours from arriving?	Turn on your TV or radio in order to get the latest weather updates and emergency instructions.  Build or restock your emergency preparedness kit. Include food and water sufficient for at least three days, medications, a flashlight, batteries, cash, and first aid supplies.  Plan how to communicate with family members if you lose power. For example, you can call, text, email or use social media. Remember that during disasters, sending text messages is usually reliable and faster than making phone calls because phone lines are often overloaded.  Review your evacuation plan with your family. You may have to leave quickly so plan ahead.  Keep your car in good working condition, and keep the gas tank full; stock your vehicle with emergency supplies and a change of clothes.	https://www.ready.gov/hurricanes
what to do After a Hurricane?	Listen to local officials for updates and instructions.  Check-in with family and friends by texting or using social media.  Return home only when authorities indicate it is safe.  Watch out for debris and downed power lines.  Avoid walking or driving through flood waters. Just 6 inches of moving water can knock you down, and one foot of fast-moving water can sweep your vehicle away.  Avoid flood water as it may be electrically charged from underground or downed power lines and may hide dangerous debris or places where the ground is washed away.  Photograph the damage to your property in order to assist in filing an insurance claim.    Do what you can to prevent further damage to your property, (e.g., putting a tarp on a damaged roof), as insurance may not cover additional damage that occurs after the storm.	https://www.ready.gov/hurricanes
How to Make a hurricane plan?	Know your hurricane risk (https://community.fema.gov/hazard/hurricane-en_us/be-smart?lang=en_US). Talk to your local emergency management agency. Make an emergency plan (http://www.ready.gov/make-a-plan).  Sign up for alerts and warnings Make a Family Communication plan  Know where to go and how to get there should you need to get to higher ground or to evacuate.	https://www.ready.gov/hurricanes

What is a nuclear bomb?	A nuclear bomb produces a large blast with intense light and heat, a damaging pressure wave, and widespread radioactive material that can contaminate the air, water, and ground surfaces for miles around. A nuclear device can range from a weapon carried by a missile, to a small portable nuclear device transported by an individual. All nuclear devices cause deadly effects when exploded.	EmResBot.docx
What are the odds of nuclear war?	The danger of a strategic nuclear attack on the United States is predicted by experts to be less likely today. However, terrorism, by nature, is unpredictable.	EmResBot.docx
What are targets of nuclear bomb or missiles?	Targets include strategic missile sites and military bases. Centers of government and state capitals. Important transportation and communication centers. Manufacturing, industrial, technology, and financial centers. Petroleum refineries, electrical power plants, and chemical plants. Major ports and airfields.	EmResBot.docx
How to protect from nuclear bomb?	**Distance** - the more distance between you and the fallout particles, the better. An underground area such as a home or office building basement offers more protection than the first floor of a building. **Shielding** - the heavier and denser the materials - thick walls, concrete, bricks, books and earth - between you and the fallout particles, the better. **Time** - fallout radiation loses its intensity fairly rapidly. In time, you will be able to leave the fallout shelter. Radioactive fallout poses the greatest threat to people during the first two weeks, by which time it has declined to about 1 percent of its initial radiation level.	EmResBot.docx
Where is the nearest bomb shelter?	Contact the local Army Reserve or National Guard for nearby locations. Many basements at state armories also served as bomb shelters. It's also a good idea to contact your state department of historic preservation or state recreation department, as some old National Guard armories were eventually sold to municipalities and converted into recreation centers.  Bomb shelters can also be located by looking for the bomb shelter sign: http://www.civildefensemuseum.com/signs/	EmResBot.docx
How to prepare for a nuclear war?	The following are things you can do to protect yourself, your family and your property in the event of a nuclear blast. Build an [Emergency Supply Kit](http://www.ready.gov/build-a-kit) Make a [Family Emergency Plan](http://www.ready.gov/make-a-plan). Find out from officials if any public buildings in your community have been designated as fallout shelters. If your community has no designated fallout shelters, make a list of potential shelters near your home, workplace and school, such as basements, subways, tunnels, or the windowless center area of middle floors in a high-rise building. During periods of heightened threat increase your disaster supplies.	EmResBot.docx
What if there's nuclear war?	Listen for official information and follow the instructions provided by emergency response personnel. If an attack warning is issued, take cover as quickly as you can, below ground if possible, and stay there until instructed to do otherwise. Find the nearest building, preferably built of brick or concrete, and go inside to avoid any radioactive material outside. Go as far below ground as possible or in the center of a tall building. During the time with the highest radiation levels it is safest to stay inside, sheltered away from the radioactive material outside. Radiation levels are extremely dangerous after a nuclear detonation but the levels reduce rapidly. Expect to stay inside for at least 24 hours unless told otherwise by authorities. When evacuating is in your best interest, you will be instructed to do so. All available methods of communication will be used to provide news and / or instructions.	EmResBot.docx
What if Im in a nuclear attack?	Do not look at the flash or fireball - it can blind you. Take cover behind anything that might offer protection. Lie flat on the ground and cover your head. If the explosion is some distance away, it could take 30 seconds or more for the blast wave to hit. Take shelter as soon as you can, even if you are many miles from ground zero where the attack occurred - radioactive fallout can be carried by the winds for hundreds of miles. If you were outside during or after the blast, get clean as soon as possible, to remove radioactive material that may have settled on your body. Remove your clothing to keep radioactive material from spreading. Removing the outer layer of clothing can remove up to 90% of radioactive material. When possible, take a shower with lots of soap and water to help remove radioactive contamination. Do not scrub or scratch the skin. Wash your hair with shampoo or soap and water. Do not use conditioner. Gently blow your nose and wipe your eyelids and eyelashes with a clean wet cloth. Gently wipe your ears. If you cannot shower, use a wipe or clean wet cloth to wipe your skin that was not covered by clothing.

How to prepare for active shooter?	Sign up for active shooter training. If you see something, say something to an authority right away. Sign up to receive local emergency alerts and register your work and personal contact information with any work sponsored alert system. Be aware of your environment and any possible dangers.	EmResBot_AS.docx
How to make an active shooter plan?	Make a plan with your family, and ensure everyone knows what they would do, if confronted with an active shooter. Look for the two nearest exits anywhere you go, and have an escape path in mind & identify places you could hide. Understand the plans for individuals with disabilities or other access and functional needs.	EmResBot_AS.docx
What to do during an active shooter?	**RUN and escape, if possible.** Getting away from the shooter or gunmen is the top priority. Leave your belongings behind and get away. Help others escape, if possible, but evacuate regardless of whether others agree to follow. Warn and prevent individuals from entering an area where the active shooter may be. Call 911 when you are safe, and describe shooter, location, and weapons. **HIDE, if escape is not possible.** Get out of the shooter's view and stay very quiet. Silence all electronic devices and make sure they won't vibrate. Lock and block doors, close blinds, and turn off lights. Don't hide in groups- spread out along walls or hide separately to make it more difficult for the shooter. Try to communicate with police silently through text message or social media- so they know geo-tagged location, or by putting a sign in a window. Stay in place until law enforcement gives you the all clear. Your hiding place should be out of the shooter's view and provide protection if shots are fired in your direction. **FIGHT as an absolute last resort.** Commit to your actions and act as aggressively as possible against him/her. Recruit others to ambush the shooter with makeshift weapons like chairs, fire extinguishers, scissors, books, etc. to distract and disarm the shooter. Be prepared to cause severe or lethal injury to the shooter. Throw items and improvise weapons.	EmResBot_AS.docx
What to do after an active shooter?	Keep hands visible and empty. Know that law enforcement's first task is to end the incident, and they may have to pass injured along the way. Follow law enforcement instructions and evacuate in the direction they come from. Officers may be armed with rifles, shotguns, and/or handguns and may use pepper spray or tear gas to control the situation. Officers will shout commands and may push individuals to the ground for their safety. Consider seeking professional help for you and your family to cope with the long-term effects of the trauma. Helping the Wounded. Take care of yourself first, and then you may be able to help the wounded before first responders arrive: if the injured are in immediate danger, help get them to safety. While you wait for first responders to arrive, provide first aid- apply direct pressure to wounded and use tourniquets if you have been trained to do so; Turn wounded people onto their sides if they are unconscious and keep them warm.

How to prepare for a bio attack?	A biological attack may or may not be immediately obvious. In most cases local health care workers will report a pattern of unusual illness or there will be a wave of sick people seeking emergency medical attention. The public would be alerted through an emergency radio or TV broadcast, or some other signal used in your community, such as a telephone call or a home visit from an emergency response worker. The following are things you can do to protect yourself, your family and your property from the effects of a biological threat: Build an [Emergency Supply Kit](https://www.ready.gov/build-a-kit) Make a [Family Emergency Plan](https://www.ready.gov/make-a-plan) Check with your doctor to ensure all required or suggested immunizations are up to date for yourself, your children and elderly family members. Consider installing a High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter in your furnace return duct, which will filter out most biological agents that may enter your house	EmResBot_Bio.docx
How to survive a bioterrorist attack?	The first evidence of an attack may be when you notice symptoms of the disease caused by exposure to an agent. In the event of a biological attack, public health officials may not immediately be able to provide information on what you should do. It will take time to determine exactly what the illness is, how it should be treated, and who is in danger. Follow these guidelines during a biological threat:&amp;nbsp; check the Internet for official news and information including signs and symptoms of the disease, areas in danger. If you become aware of an unusual and suspicious substance, quickly get away. Cover your mouth and nose with layers of fabric that can filter the air but still allow breathing. Examples include two to three layers of cotton such as a t-shirt, handkerchief or towel. Depending on the situation, wear a face mask to reduce inhaling or spreading germs. If you have been exposed to a biological agent, remove and bag your clothes and personal items. Follow official instructions for disposal of contaminated items. Wash yourself with soap and water and put on clean clothes. Contact authorities and seek medical assistance. You may be advised to stay away from others or even quarantined. If your symptoms match those described and you are in the group considered at risk, immediately seek emergency medical attention. Wash your hands with soap and water frequently.	EmResBot_Bio.docx

Building Security - EMERGENCY GUIDE	**Building Security**   Be aware of your surrounding s Report suspicious activities or anything that seems out of place to 9-1-1.  Avoid the habit of routinely leaving valuables on the desk unguarded. Carelessly hanging a purse or jacket containing your wallet, keys or other items of value behind your desk chair or on a coat rack is asking for trouble. Valuables should not be left in or on your desk unattended or overnight. Rings, watches, money, pocket calculators and small radios are easy targets for thieves. Activate a "buddy system" when traveling to your car, or in isolated areas after hours. Exercise caution when using the elevator. If a suspicious person enters the elevator, exit before the doors close. Insist that all deliveries and pickups be made at the Reception desk or other designated area. No outside messengers should be allowed to roam the premises.	https://wework-mobile.s3.amazonaws.com/guides/safety_guides/NY21%20Emergency%20Plan%20-%20Updated%202nd%20Floor%20%281%29.pdf
Care of Disabled Persons in an Emergency	**Care of Disabled Persons in an Emergency**   Prevent injury and further damage to a victim. Ensure safety for yourself and others. You have no duty to come to the aid of a stricken person. However you may voluntarily assist the victim to the degree that you are trained. Keep a level head. A demand for immediate action often translates into insecurity and fear. Keep your focus and concentrate. Be patient.  Speak clearly and directly about the emergency. When responding to assist a disabled person, identify yourself and your purpose for being there. Allow the individual the opportunity to establish your position before you continue. Use "clock-face" directions to orient people. For example: "The door is at 3 o'clock." Use a pad and pencil as an alternative method to language. It enables you to  describe a message in pictures. Be simple and clear. Write slowly and give yourself plenty of room for "comment." Isolate hysterical people and deal with them in simple, firm, and clear language. Emergency situations can be disorienting for the disabled person because of unexpected circumstances and lack of control.	https://wework-mobile.s3.amazonaws.com/guides/safety_guides/NY21%20Emergency%20Plan%20-%20Updated%202nd%20Floor%20%281%29.pdf
Use of Extinguishers	**Use of Extinguishers** Dry chemical fire extinguishers are located at strategic points around the building. Extinguishers are the first line of defense in fighting fires. Each extinguisher is the proper type for the fire that will most likely occur in that vicinity. If a fire is discovered while it is still small enough for the extinguisher to be effective:    Remove the extinguisher from its place and hold it upright. Stand back 8 to 10 feet from the fire. Follow the acronym P A S S:   Pull the retaining pin.   Aim the nozzle at the base of the flames, and   Squeeze the handle completely. This will discharge the extinguishing agent at the fire. Use a sweeping motion from side-to-side sweep the base of the fire. When you extinguish a fire, a great amount of smoke may be generated, so be very careful. The smoke may also generate noxious fumes, exercise caution.   Close as many doors and windows behind you as possible to contain the fire to the smallest area.	https://wework-mobile.s3.amazonaws.com/guides/safety_guides/NY21%20Emergency%20Plan%20-%20Updated%202nd%20Floor%20%281%29.pdf

There's a man with a gun.	**RUN and escape, if possible.** Getting away from the shooter or gunmen\n is the top priority. Leave your belongings behind and get away. Help others escape, if possible, but evacuate regardless of whether others agree to follow. Warn and prevent individuals from entering an area where the active shooter may be. Call 911 when you are safe, and describe shooter, location, and weapons. **HIDE, if escape is not possible.** Get out of the shooter's view and stay very quiet. Silence all electronic devices and make sure they won't vibrate. Lock and block doors, close blinds, and turn off lights. Don't hide in groups- spread out along walls or hide separately to make it more difficult for the shooter. Try to communicate with police silently through text message or social media- so they know geo-tagged location, or by putting a sign in\n a window. Stay in place until law enforcement gives you the all clear. Your hiding place should be out of the shooter's view and provide protection if shots are fired in your direction. **FIGHT as an absolute last resort.** Commit to your actions and act as aggressively as possible against him/her. Recruit others to ambush the shooter with makeshift weapons like chairs, fire extinguishers, scissors, books, etc. to distract and disarm the shooter. Be prepared to cause severe or lethal injury to the shooter. Throw items and improvise weapons.	Editorial
